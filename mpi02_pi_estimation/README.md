# Exercise: mpi_pi_estimation

The exercise is to estimate pi based on Monte Carlo method
The total number of tosses is provided as input at execution time. this number is later divided equally by node 0 and send to all nodes for calculation of numberInCircle.

The circle is assumed with radius of 1. Hence coordinate value to toss shall be generated by (x,y) from 0<(x,y)<1. eg of x=0.4264 y=0.1645. 
(x,y) is said inside of circle if x*x + y*y <1
numberInCircle is accumulated in all nodes and consolidated by MPI_Reduce with operator SUM
PI is then calculated with this formula
piEstimate = 4*sumNumberInCircle/((double) (totalToss));
The result is then printed by node 0

Note: Although the program is capable to execute with total tosses with long long int size (means +9,223,372,036,854,775,807)
However, it is recommended to verify the program with total tosses <10,000,000 to ensure program ended properly

### Compiling and running your program on OCuLUS ###

```shell
# login to frontend
ssh fe.pc2.uni-paderborn.de

# load compiler and openmp
module load openmpi
module load gcc

# compile program
mpicc -o mpi_pi_estimation mpi_pi_estimation.c
or 
make all

# submit program to Oculus as an interactive job
ccsalloc -I --res=rset=8:ncpus=1 ompi -- ./mpi_pi_estimation 10000000
```
